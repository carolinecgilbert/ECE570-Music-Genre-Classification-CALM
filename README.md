# ECE570-Music-Genre-Classification-CALM

The CALM model is reimplemented in the Music-Genre-Classification-CALM.ipynb file that uses the data from Data/Datasets/train_loader.pt and Data/Datasets/test_loader.pt. To get these data files, run the Data/downloadGTZAN.py file which gets those files from Google Drive. However, this repository also contains the Data/Data_Preprocessing.py file which shows how to preprocess the data with the GTZAN data; however, GTZAN is too large to download using gdown so this file is just for reference. 

## Run the code
Use the requirements.txt file to set up the environment and run the downloadGTZAN.py file the Data folder. Next, the Music-Genre-Classification-CALM.ipynb can be used to run the CALM model.
